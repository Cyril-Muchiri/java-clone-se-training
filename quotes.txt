Without faith, there is no force of will.
Turn your obstacles into opportunities and your problems into possibilities.
All the energy that you put into your life returns to you. Just as the energy spent on the good will return to you the bad will too. Do not focus on your misfortune. Focus on the good. Focus on your gratitude. Look to be grateful and you will always find something to be grateful for.
I will not play it safe! I want to experience the length, depth, and breadth of life. I'm not just here for the victories... I'm here for the scars.
Positive thinking is powerful thinking. If you want happiness, fulfillment, success and inner peace, start thinking you have the power to achieve those things. Focus on the bright side of life and expect positive results.
In order to become strong tomorrow, stand up and fight today.
I dont celebrate any friendship that was build on hate, because we share the common enemy.
We are now past the era of speculation and blame. We need to create the era of positive direct action.
